The Java testing library uses JUnit to perform unit tests and
Checkstyle to check source code style. These libraries are not
distributed with the Testovid system.

In order to use unit tests you must first install the JUnit library
by placing junit.jar and hamcrest-core.jar in a subfolder named junit.

In order to use code style checks you must install the Checkstyle
library by placing checkstyle.jar in a subfolder named checkstyle
and also providing the deafult configuration in the same subfolder
as a file named checkstyle.defaults.xml.
