Usage
=====

1. Create the folders for your course and assignments. For example,
for a course named "Example" and the assignement named "Java" the
folders should be:
/path/to/testovid/courses/Example/Java/solutions
/path/to/testovid/courses/Example/Java/test

2. Populate the former folder with student solutions and the
latter with a domain specific tester for the assignment

3. Run the Testovid system in batch mode on all the suplied
solutions using the "all" script:
all <course.id> <assignment.id> <locale>

For example, to test all solutions of the "Java" assignment
on the course "Example" on Windows and generate reports in
english, run:
all.bat Example Java EN

Another example is to test all solutions gathered for the second
assignment on Data Structures course on Linux and generate
the reports in german:
all.sh data-structures 2-stack DE

4. After all tests have been completed, one report file will
be generated for each test attempt. The report is named after
the student id and a time stamp, and is placed in the "results"
subfolder of the assignment. Also, one .csv file is generated
containing results for all the solutions. Depending on the tests
performed by the domain specific tester zero or more .rep files
will be generated in the folders containing gathered solutions,
one for each tested aspect.

5. To run the system in online mode and test just one solution
without collecting the files in Testovid installation folder,
run the "one" script in the folder containing the student's files.
one <course.id> <assignment.id> <locale>

The reports will be generated in the folder where the script was run.
